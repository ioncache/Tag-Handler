1.3.1 2012-09-10
    - fixed issue with autoUpdate when the tag didn't exist before

1.3.0 2012-05-05
    - added afterAdd and afterDelete callbacks -- pull request from liddellj
    - fixed issue where adding html reserved characters (<> etc) were bing interpreted as HTML -- now using .text() instead of .html() to read/write tags -- reported by bull5_i oin Disqus comments
    - fixed issue where hitting backspace to remove a tag does not actually delete the tag from the tag list, nor did it return the tag text in the onDelete callback -- issue reported by Eduardo Pereira from Disqus comments
    - fixed some syntax and scope errors after linting

1.2.1 2011-12-11
    - modified the code for the onAdd & onDelete callbacks to ensure the tag name was being properly being passed to the functions

1.2.0 2011-12-11
    - added plugin convenience methods
        - getTags: returns an array of tags
        - getSerializedTags: returns comma separated string of tags
    - added options for callback functions onAdd & onDelete -- these execute after adding or deleting a tag (ryanhollister -- issue #6)
    - modified the way that the ajax retrieval of tags from the server when initLoad is set to false expects returned data to be more in line with the rest of the AJAX calls -- the server must now return an object with an availableTags array just like the other ajax calls or the regualr tag setup
      *** NOTE ***: this is not backwards compatible with previous versions of the Tag-Handler (although I'm not sure how well used this functionality is anyhow)
    - fixed: issue with the getData & updateData options which were being initalized as strings instead of objects (sebpiq )

1.1.0 2011-03-29
    - added maxTags option to limit the maximum number of tags allowed
    - added check for all autocomplete functions to ensure that jQueryUI autocomplete is enabled

    - saved $(tagContainer) to a variable to save on some jQuery function calls
